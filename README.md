## Pixy Settings Considerations. 

We seemed to have a decent amount of success using 115200 for the baud rate of the camera. This is easy to set using the PixyMon software you can obtain at the pixy website [here](https://pixycam.com/downloads-pixy1/). The specifics on how to navigate the software and change these settings can be located on the wiki page [here](https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v1:porting_guide).
